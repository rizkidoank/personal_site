      <description>Its been a while I am using Ansible as a tool for configuration management. There was some conditions where I created a roles with multiple dependencies, or I have to revisit an ancient roles created by someone else in the past. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if the roles are well tested, how if its untested or doesn&amp;rsquo;t have tests at all?
In the past, I test ansible role by creating a vagrant box and run ansible playbook in it.</description>
